## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

  - Flutter SDK installed (version 3.x.x or higher)
  - A code editor like VS Code or Android Studio
  - A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient)

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/supachat.git
cd supachat
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

**3. Set up Supabase**

  - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.

  - Navigate to **Project Settings \> API**. Find your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**.

  - You'll also need to set up your database schema. Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project and run the following script to create the `messages` and `profiles` tables:

    ```sql
    -- Create a table for public profiles
    create table profiles (
      id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
      updated_at timestamp with time zone,
      username text unique,
      avatar_url text,
      website text,

      constraint username_length check (char_length(username) >= 3)
    );
    -- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
    alter table profiles
      enable row level security;

    create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles
      for select using (true);

    create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles
      for insert with check (auth.uid() = id);

    create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles
      for update using (auth.uid() = id);

    -- Create a table for messages
    create table messages (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      profile_id uuid references public.profiles not null,
      content text not null,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );
    -- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
    alter table messages
      enable row level security;

    create policy "Users can view all messages." on messages
      for select using (true);

    create policy "Users can insert their own messages." on messages
      for insert with check (auth.uid() = profile_id);
    ```

**4. Add Supabase Credentials**

  - Open the project in your code editor.

  - Navigate to `lib/main.dart` (or your designated constants/env file).

  - Initialize Supabase with the credentials from the previous step:

    ```dart
    // lib/main.dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

      await Supabase.initialize(
        url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
        anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
      );
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    ```

**5. Run the App**

```bash
flutter run
```
